nsf-grad-analysis
=================

This is just a fun little project to practice data analysis in R and to learn more about using ggplot and other R tools.

I downloaded some data on NSF Graduate Research Fellowship awardees from the past few years, extracted information on University of California schools, and made some graphs.

nsf-grad-analysis.R has the full code from start to finish

data-import.R has the import code. I've imported and combined data from 2009-2014. I've exported the resulting data as a csv for downstream analysis.
